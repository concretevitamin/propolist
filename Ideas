Single User First.
    - /: display of added theorems (GET).
    - /intro: brief introduction.
    - /search: searching theorems.
    - /search_res: search results.
    - /add: add theorems (LaTeX support).

Backend (necessary or not?):
    - ADT (algebraic / abstract data types).
    - Store, load (how to communicate with Yesod?).
    - Manipulations of theorems (e.g. sort). 

Approaches proposal: build a cli-based backend first, then integrate with yesod.
